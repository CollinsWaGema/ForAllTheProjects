            <p>Bora Bora is a small South Pacific island northwest of Tahiti in French Polynesia. Famous for its turquoise lagoon, 
                lush volcanic peaks, and luxury overwater bungalows, it’s often called the ultimate honeymoon paradise. But it’s more 
                than just a pretty face — it’s a whole vibe.</p>

                    <li>Bora Bora has no “B” in the native Tahitian language — it’s actually <em>pronounced *Pora Pora*</em>, meaning "first born".</li>
                    <li>It’s a former U.S. military supply base during WWII — and traces of that still exist!</li>

                    in the center, offering hikes and boat tours that feel like stepping into a movie.</p>
